# College Coding Projects

This repository contains most of the coding projects I work on during my time at college. It serves as a central place to organize, share, and track my progress across different subjects and programming languages.

## Structure

- Each folder typically represents a course, topic, or project.
- Documentation and notes may be included where relevant.
